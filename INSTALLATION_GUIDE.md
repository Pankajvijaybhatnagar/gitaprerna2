## 📥 Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Extract the Project

   - **Suggested:** Desktop or Documents folder
3. Remember this location!

#### Windows:
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to `gita-prerna-complete` folder
3. Type `cmd` in the address bar
4. Press Enter

**OR**

1. Right-click folder
2. Select "Open in Terminal" (Windows 11)
3. Or "Open PowerShell window here" (Windows 10)

```

✅ You should see these files:
- package.json
- next.config.js
- tailwind.config.js
- app/ folder

❌ If you don't see these, you're in the wrong folder!

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

**This is the most important step!**

Type this command:
```bash
npm install
```

**What happens:**
1. npm reads `package.json`
2. Downloads ALL required packages
3. Creates `node_modules/` folder (~200MB)
4. Downloads 300+ packages
5. Takes 2-5 minutes depending on internet speed

**Expected output:**
```
npm WARN deprecated ...
... (lots of downloading messages) ...
added 312 packages, and audited 313 packages in 2m

45 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

✅ **Success!** If you see "added XXX packages"
❌ **Error?** See troubleshooting below

### Step 5: Start the Development Server

Type:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
   ▲ Next.js 15.1.3
   - Local:        http://localhost:3000
   - Environments: .env.local

 ✓ Starting...
 ✓ Ready in 2.3s
```

✅ **Success!** App is running!

### Step 6: Open in Browser

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Type in address bar: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Press Enter

**You should see:**
- Beautiful home page with ॐ symbol
- "गीता प्रेरणा" heading
- "Explore Chapters" button
- Animated elements

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Browser shows home page
- [ ] Navigation menu works
- [ ] Can click "Explore Chapters"
- [ ] Can see 2 chapters

## 📂 What Got Installed

After `npm install`, your folder now has:

```
gita-prerna-complete/
├── node_modules/           ← NEW! (~200MB)
│   ├── next/
│   ├── react/
│   ├── framer-motion/
│   └── ... (300+ packages)
│
├── package-lock.json       ← NEW! (auto-generated)
│
└── ... (all your original files)
```

## 🔧 Understanding npm install

### What is node_modules?

- Folder containing all JavaScript libraries
- Required for the app to work
- **NOT included in download** (too large: 200MB)
- Generated by `npm install`
- Safe to delete and regenerate

### Why download separately?

1. **Size**: 200MB is too large to include
2. **Platform-specific**: Some packages compile differently on Windows/Mac/Linux
3. **Updates**: You get the latest compatible versions
4. **Standard practice**: All Node.js projects work this way

### What is package.json?

- List of dependencies and their versions
- Like a "shopping list" for npm
- npm reads this to know what to download

### What is package-lock.json?

- Exact versions of installed packages
- Auto-generated by npm
- Ensures everyone gets same versions
- Commit this to git (if using version control)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting npm install

### Error: "npm: command not found"

**Problem:** Node.js not installed correctly

**Solution:**
1. Reinstall Node.js from nodejs.org
2. Restart your terminal/computer
3. Verify: `node --version`

### Error: "EACCES: permission denied"

**Problem:** Permission issues (Mac/Linux)

**Solution:**
```bash
sudo npm install
# Enter your password when prompted
```

### Error: "ENOENT: no such file or directory"

**Problem:** Wrong folder or corrupted files

**Solution:**
1. Verify you're in correct folder: `ls` or `dir`
2. Re-extract the zip file
3. Try again

### Error: "network timeout" or "fetch failed"

**Problem:** Internet connection issues

**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Try again: `npm install`
3. If using VPN, try without it
4. Use different network if possible

### Error: "npm ERR! code ERESOLVE"

**Problem:** Dependency conflicts

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Error: Takes forever / Seems stuck

**Problem:** Slow internet or large download

**Solution:**
- Be patient! Can take 5-10 minutes on slow internet
- Check internet speed
- npm is still working if you see any activity
- Don't close terminal!

### Error: "gyp ERR!" or build errors

**Problem:** Missing build tools (usually Windows)

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
```

**Or install Windows build tools:**
```bash
npm install -g windows-build-tools
```

## 🎯 Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to install node_modules every time?

**A:** No! Only once. node_modules stays in your folder.

### Q: Can I delete node_modules?

**A:** Yes, but you'll need to run `npm install` again.

### Q: Why is node_modules so big?

**A:** It contains 300+ packages with all their code. Normal for modern web apps.

### Q: Do I commit node_modules to git?

**A:** No! It's in `.gitignore`. Only commit `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

### Q: Can I copy node_modules between projects?

**A:** No! Each project needs its own. Don't copy, run `npm install`.

### Q: What if npm install fails completely?

**A:** Try:
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Try installing again
npm install
```

### Q: Can I use yarn instead of npm?

**A:** Yes!
```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```
